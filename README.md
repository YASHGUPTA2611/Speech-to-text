# Speech-to-text

## In this repository, i have created a google colab notebook which uses Chat GPT model api and prompt engineering to converting audio into text.

There are 3 services :- 

1.) Via Audio inout file -> In this function, we can input any audio file in a Google Colab notebook by specifying the file path and assigning it to the "audio_file_path" variable. When we run the cell, the output will be stored in the "audio_file_output" variable.

2.) Via Youtube video link -> In this function, we provide a YouTube video link that we want to convert into text. When we run the entire cell, the speech from the video will be converted into text and stored in the variable "youtube_output".

3.) Via Mic -> When we run the cell, it will first prompt for audio input, which is captured from the device microphone. The input audio is then used to convert the saved audio into text, which is stored as "Mic_output" variable.

Use the above funcions as per your Requirement.

### Thank You
